PC Speaker PWM code, extracted from MUSHROOM.COM demo

Old mushroom.com PC demo/advertisement provides mush better PWM sound on PC speaker that anything i've heard on XT. 
It uses all three timer channels for that.
Uploaded my reversing attempt on that.
Still need to someone describe me what actually happens there.
